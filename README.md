# VitaMic

There were probably a million better ways to do this. but this is the easiest.

I made it because someone on discord asked.

# Usage

For the love of god turn off usb power supply in settings.

1. Connect Vita's audio out to PC's audio in with audio cable.
2. Launch App
3. Done (?)

Don't exit to livearea. It'll stop working and need a relaunch
